If same id do one at a time, otherwise can do concurrently
Only remove after successful implementation
Can explain the same Id concurrency rule as a way to make things more efficient introduce multiple instances

When do we need to worry about race conditions?
When more than one action relates to same id
Can also separate endpoints so that if user tries to create with existing id he gets error that already exists

Relate it to user intent this can be related to user requirements
What is partial update? - explain what u think it means
Might be over engineering but can we “combine partial updates?”
Talk about pro con of treating partial update as normal (slower, simpler)
What if two req are the exact same?
What if one req fails to process?
Assume at what point a req is officially “made”
What if a req is incorrect?
Enforce time stamp at time req enters system
Mention that scaling is a requirement
